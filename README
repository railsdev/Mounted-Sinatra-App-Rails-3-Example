== Example One, Running a Rails 3 App with a Sinatra Middleware Mounted

This example is the simplest approach. Here we create a dummy Rails 3
application that serves the http://www.infochimps.com/apis page

We mount the Infochimps Explorer (as a gem) onto the /datasets route.

# config/route.rb
mount Main => "/datasets" 

The only complication here is that Bundler expects to load an infochimps_explorer.rb file from the lib directory, the directory structure of the infochimps_explorer repo didn't match convention so I had to move some files around to make it work as expected. This was not a huge effort.

If you run ./script/rails server

You can visit the sample Rails application at 

http://localhost:3000  # This is the api controller

You can see the mounted application at

http://localhost:3000/datasets/describe/social/network/qwerly/qwerly_profiles/profile_search

To use this approach, the infochimps.com website would need to have
updated paths in  API description.
